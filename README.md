# now-diff

A Chrome Extension that lets you filter HBO Now's movie listing to show only "New" titles.

## Install

This extension is still a work in progress. I'm using it successfully, locally by enabling "Developer Mode" for my Chrome Extensions and then using the "Load unpacked extension..." feature. Eventually I may release this code into the Chrome web store.
